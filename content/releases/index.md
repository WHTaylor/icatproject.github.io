Releases are handled by Maven. There are regular releases which are
never changed and should be suitable for production use and snapshot
releases which are offered to people to try out but which should not be
put into production.

There is Â a list of the latest [current releases](/releases/current-release/ "Current release") and one of
available [snapshot releases](/releases/snapshot-releases/ "Snapshot releases").
