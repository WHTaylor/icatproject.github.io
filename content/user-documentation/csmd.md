title: Core Scientific Metadata Model (CSMD)
---

The model is a study-data oriented model which has been developed at
STFC over many years. It captures high level information about
scientific studies and the data that they produce.  The ICAT schema
finds its origins in CSMD.

The CSMD is developed to support data collected within a facility's
scientific workflow. However the model is also designed to be generic
across scientific disciplines and has application beyond facilities
science, particularly in the "structural sciences" (such as chemistry,
material science, earth science, and biochemistry) which are concerned
with analysing the structure of substances, and perform systematic
experimental analyses on samples of those materials.

The model is organised around a notion of Studies, a study being a body
of scientific work on a particular subject of investigation. During a
study, a scientist would perform a number of investigations e.g.
experiments, observations, measurements and simulations. Results from
these investigations usually run through different stages: raw data,
analysed or derived data and end results suitable for publication. The
model has a hierarchical model of the structure of scientific research
programmes, projects and studies, and also a generic model of the
organisation of data sets into collections and files.
