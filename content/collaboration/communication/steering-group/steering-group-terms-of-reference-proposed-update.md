title: STEERING GROUP TERMS OF REFERENCE – PROPOSED UPDATE
---

THIS IS A PROPOSAL FOR AN UPDATE TO THE TERMS OF REFERENCE TO COMPLETE
SC ACTIONS 2.2 AND 2.7

The ICAT Steering Committee provides a forum for representatives of the
stakeholders in ICAT to steer and advise on the priorities and the
direction of the ICAT suite of data management components (referred to
as ICAT).    ICAT developers already meet regularly to discuss current
progress, under the coordination of the Project manager of the ICAT
project.  However, as an open-source collaboration, it requires
oversight and guidance from all senior members of stakeholder
organisations involved to ensure that it continues to develop as a
valuable component for data management within facilities
infrastructure.  The Steering Committee will meet more infrequently to
undertake this role.

# Purpose

The Committee exists for the following reasons:

- to advise on the likely usage and requirements for ICAT;
- to provide senior management oversight for the work of the ICAT
  collaboration partners;
- to provide strategic guidance on the development and deployment of
  ICAT.

# Responsibilities of the ICAT Steering Committee

The members of the Committee have the following responsibilities:

- to provide strategic advice to the collaboration;
- to protect the interests of the institution which they represent;
- to advise on new initiatives and plans which may affect the
  development of ICAT;
- to advise on major requirements which may affect the development of
  ICAT;
- to oversee the ICAT development roadmap, including the incorporation
  of additional components into ICAT which have been proposed by
  developers or users;
- to ensure that ICAT components continue to remain aligned to the
  aims of the stakeholders, within a common functionality and code
  base;
- to advise on ownership, licencing of components and
  commercialisation opportunities;
- to ensure that the institution which they represent provides
  appropriate resources to the collaboration.

# Membership
