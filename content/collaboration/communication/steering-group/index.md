title: Steering Group
---

The ICAT Steering Group provides a forum for representatives of the
stakeholders in ICAT to steer and advise on the priorities and the
direction of the ICAT suite of data management components. ICAT
developers already meet regularly to discuss progress, under the
coordination of the manager of the ICAT project. However, as
an open-source collaboration, it requires oversight and guidance from
stakeholders.

A [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/icatproject-steering) for
the group is available; anyone can post to this list and anyone can read
it however membership is only the steering group.

The [Terms of Reference](/collaboration/communication/steering-group/steering-group-terms-of-reference/) are available as is a [proposed update](/collaboration/communication/steering-group/steering-group-terms-of-reference-proposed-update/)
