We could not contact George for the meeting, but he send this report:

1\. The installation and testing will happen the following weeks as some
key persons were not available these days.

2\. The date for WP4
PaNdata[?](https://code.google.com/p/icatproject/w/edit/PaNdata) telco
will be announced next week.

3\. During the WP4 telco we will identify the ICAT responsible for most
facilities. (but I expect to be slow procedure as the WP has just
started).
