### Notes 57

The meeting discussed actions from earlier meetings and updated the
status of actions.

The meeting discussed the arrival of CCFE as a collaborator. Alistair
agreed to send a note to the collaboration about this. There is now a
note called
InductionProcess[?](https://code.google.com/p/icatproject/w/edit/InductionProcess) on
the wiki. The intention is to follow this process and to enhance the
note. The purpose of this is to ensure that new partners get off to a
good start. We look forward to having a representative of CCFE attend
one of these meetings.

The meeting discussed the status of the reference implementation of the
IDS. One part of this is called the Download Manager. This is now in
pre-production with both the ISIS and DLS facilities. It will also be
used as part of the service verification which will be conducted by
Pandata. It was agreed to make a distribution of the download manager.
This is a technology preview, and should only be used for testing.

As Steve Fisher is on vacation, the meeting did not discuss the status
of ICAT 4.3.

Tom has created a google group called icat-issues@googlegroups.com.
Alistair agreed to add a link to this group
on[http://www.icatproject.org](http://www.icatproject.org/).

The meeting concluded after 20 minutes. A new record for
brevity\!
