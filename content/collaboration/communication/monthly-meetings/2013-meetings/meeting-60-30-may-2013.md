### Notes 60

We were pleased to have Milan join us again. He has been away from work
for a month following an operation on his wrist.

Ghita informed us that she is going to leave Diamond in June to take up
an academic position teaching Computer Science in a University. The
chairman thanked Ghita for her work with ICAT and wished her well in her
new position.

Steve said that work on ICAT 4.3 was progressing well, with the
development of Notifications and Logging completed. He will deal with
Free text next. He said that when he completes the development of a
feature, he changes the status of the corresponding ticket to started.
The ticket will be closed when the feature is included in a release. If
further work is required following release, a new ticket will be
created.

Alistair reported that he had written notes about the release conditions
for ICAT and IDS. He will send an email to the mailing list inviting
comments.

Steve reported that the IJP is now ready for deployment in LSF at STFC.
A paper has been written and will be presented at a conference in Zurich
new week. He agreed to finalise a release of this product and to make an
announcement.

Steve reported that as Antony has left the project, we are short of
resources for the development and support of Topcat. We would very much
appreciate it, if one of our partners were to volunteer to support or
develop Topcat.

Alistair reported that as Frazer has left the project, we have recruited
a student who will join for three months from the beginning of
September. His main task will be to prepare the IDS for release. We are
expecting to have Frazer working with the project team from September
again. This will provide continuity in the work with IDS.

Alistair and Steve reported that STFC is going to recruit at least one
contractor for several months to support the ICAT related work until a
permanent replacement can be found for Antony.

The meeting finished at 15:25
BST.
