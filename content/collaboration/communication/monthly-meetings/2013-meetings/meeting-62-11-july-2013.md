### Notes 62

Present: Daniel Salvat, Pablo Garcia, David Lopez, George Kourousias,
Tom Griffin and Steve Fisher (Chair)

SMF: ICAT4.3 now needs two more things: schema changes with associated
scripts and enhanced query language. End of August still looks possible.

Rolf Krahl’s simple authenticator has been released and at some point a
class he has written to handle hashed passwords will also be used by the
db authenticator.

A SNAPSHOT of TopCAT 1.9 has been made available – no feedback has been
received so far.

Releases of ice (an ICAT Editor and icat-setup for editing authz related
tables) are imminent. Kevin will test them both before release.

TG: ISIS is still using ICAT3.3 and is waiting for ICAT4.3 with the
enhanced query language to support more specific rules.

GK: Umbrella will be part of the next PaNData verifications so will
probably need an umbrella authenticator.

DS: Reminder about the Barcelona workshop which is expected to have two
satellite meetings: one on icat and and one on
umbrella.
