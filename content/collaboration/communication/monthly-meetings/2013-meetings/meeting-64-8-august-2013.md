### Notes 64

Present: Alistair (STFC/chair), Kevin (STFC), Tom (ISIS), Ivan (CCFE)
and Steve (STFC)

As it is August, the meeting was quiet.

Ivan from CCFE joined the conference for the first time. CCFE is the
Centre for Fusion Energy. We welcome CCFE to the collaboration.

The Pandata meeting in Barcelona in September was discussed. It was
noted that there would NOT be a meeting about ICAT. However Steve
offered to host a web cast session in September where he would discuss
the contents of ICAT 4.3.

It was agreed to invite members of the collaboration to offer to host a
face to face meeting of ICAT in March 2014.

Steve discussed the status of ICAT 4.3 and reported that progress was
good. He will make a snapshot of the software and the documentation
available to interested parties later in August. Following that, he will
release ICAT 4.3. During September, he will host a webcast session to
discuss ICAT 4.3.

There are no known problems with the production deployments.

Ivan reported that he was making progress with ICAT. At the moment he is
investigating how to integrate ICAT with other meta data systems at
CCFE.

Steve reported that he intends to move www.icatproject.org to a new host
during August. The new host will be located within STFC and have a new
IP address. This change should not affect anyone using the resources
such as the maven repository on www.icatproject.org.

The meeting concluded at
15h30.
