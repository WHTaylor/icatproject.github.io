### Notes 50

Shelly asked that additional information such as venue, contact names
and hotel details be added to the wiki for the conference in Sweden. See
actions 50.01 and 50.02.

Milan reported that he was working on a deliverable for WP4 of Pandata,
but requires data from Thorsten in DESY. Thorsten is still on vacation
and so the deliverable will be delayed until the data is available. He
is expecting to use the data for the next service verification on 1
February. When this has occurred, the deliverable can be completed.

Steve reported that he was considering including some speculative
features in ICAT 4.3. These speculative features are being introduced to
support data mining and they may change or be removed from future ICATs.
There was discussion about how to achieve this. The meeting did not
agree any particular mechanism. It was proposed that odd numbered minor
revisions such as 4.3 may contain such features, but even numbered
revisions such as 4.2 and 4.4 do not. A facility using ICAT would
normally go from even to even. However where a Facility requires a
speculative feature, then it may deploy an odd version on the
understanding that the interface to the speculative feature may change.
See action 50.03.

The meeting finished at 15:30.
