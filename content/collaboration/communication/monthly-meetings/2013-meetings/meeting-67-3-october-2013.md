### Notes 67

Present: Milan, George, Shelly, Steve, Tom, Wayne and Frazer

It was noted that the date of the ICAT meeting in Spring next year is
not yet fixed. It should be done soon.

It was suggested that actions 61.01 and 60.03 should be removed as they
will be done when they are ready and are not urgent.

Tom reported on his work testing the ICAT4.3.0-SNAPSHOTs. There were
still some problems to be addressed with multiple rules. He suggested
that the installation script might check for the EJBTimer. This is
present when Glassfish is installed but might have been deleted. He had
been unable to use the installation scripts on
Windows.
