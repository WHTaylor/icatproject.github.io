### Notes 55

The meeting discussed actions from earlier meetings and updated the
status.

The meeting discussed the conference in Lund. It was generally agreed
that it was successful. A number of items are worthy of note:

  - Sites such as Alba may have to enhance the reference implementation
    of IDS when it is available, to meet their requirements for data
    management;
  - There were presentations at the Pandata meeeting (such as Tom’s on
    ICAT and Umbrella integration) which should be made available to the
    ICAT collaboration;
  - There should be a half day ICAT workshop added to the Pandata
    meeting in Barcelona in September;
  - There will be a Pandata WP4 telco next week to discuss matters
    arising from the Pandata meeting in Lund.

 

The meeting discussed topics to be addressed in the next three months of
collaboration meetings – see the list above.

The meeting finished at
15h35.
