The face to face meeting for 2014 has been set for 24-25 March. The
venue is the Department of Computer Science at Trinity College, Dublin.

There will be releases of ICAT, Topcat, Authn\_shib and IDS around the
end of 2013, or the beginning of 2014.

A collection of ICAT parts will be tested as a group and adopted by
Pandata as part of the Pandata software stack release in January 2014.

There is a need to investigate the use of ICATs sharing a single lucene
index.

There was discussion about the ICAT collaboration meetings. It was
agreed to reduce the frequency of meetings from fortnightly to monthly.
It was agreed to investigate the use of alternative technology for the
meetings. The present arrangements with voice only connections in a
telephone conference does not support visual means of
communication.
