### Notes 68

Present: Steve, Tom, Wayne, Frazer, Alistair, Kunal

Tom reported that the date of the Spring meeting was still being
discussed.

As discussed at the previous meeting actions 61.01 and 60.03 have been
dropped – they will be done at some stage.

There had been a lot of useful feedback on the ICAT 4.3.0 snapshots
resulting in a number of improvements. The only remaining issue was the
inability to install it on Glassfish 4.

There has been some progress with the IDS but not much as Steve has been
working mostly on ICAT. He plans to make some changes to the API to make
it more convenient to use.

Wayne reported that there had been a review of TopCAT issues out of
which the items that should be fixed for the next release were
identified. He is working on interfacing to ICAT 4.3.0 but does not have
one installed. Tom suggested he should use the ISIS one. Tom will also
check to see if he has anything else to add to the issue
list.
