### Notes 58

The meeting discussed actions and updated the status of actions.

SMF stated that a 4.2.5 version of ICAT would be released to fix a
thread/memory leak related to the initialisation of log4j. He was
reminded that there may be a problem with the frequency of access to the
sequence table and that this might also go into 4.2.5.

SMF stated that ICAT 4.3.0 would include the changes required by ISIS
for a more powerful query language supporting more complex authz rules.

In AM’s absence GK reported on
PaNdata[?](https://code.google.com/p/icatproject/w/edit/PaNdata) SV4
which will start next week and be based on “Big V”.

AOB:

SR reported that she was working with APS on a new pilot project

SMF asked if there was any interest in a “File Authenticator”. There
wasn’t so it will not happen. The question then arose can we find out
what authenticators are present and what credentials they require.
TopCAT can manage without but at the expense of having to configure a
plugin correctly. A new requirement will be added.

AW reported that there was good progress on Noris’s admin interface to
TopCAT.

It was reported that the Chinese Neutron Source have successfully
deployed an ICAT and TopCAT.

Finally GKM reported that “Actors” had been added to
DAWN.
