Actions from previous:

**102.2** – Brian is still working on this\!

**110.1** – The ICAT Manger download link has been fixed

ICAT Components:

Steve is continuing to handover the ICAT components to Stuart.

**IDS –** Rolf reports that he still has pull requests open on the IDS.
Stuart says he will look at them with Steve.

**Topcat-** Brian reminds everyone to skip Topcat 2.3.4 as the file is
corrupt. Brian reports a few of the new features/issues he’s currently
working on: an info button on rows to toggle the meta tabs, a loading
page on start-up and fixing the download count when using multiple
facilities. Rolf asks Brian to look at the issue he posted to the group
regarding passing ids and ICAT URLs to the RESTful API.

**Installation** **and website** – Tutorial to be tested by Maxime,
Stuart welcomes any feedback.

F2F

Stuart reminds everyone that registration is still open. Stuart is asked
to send round an outline of the agenda so people know what time to book
flights for. It’s suggested to prepare as much as possible for the
document sprint to make the most efficient use of the time available.
It’s also suggested to discuss the use of DOI’s at the F2F.

AOB

Stuart reports he has an apprentice who’s working on converting the ICAT
install instructions to Ansible. This can be used in continuous
integration to test the ICAT components. In the future could be
potentially used for Selenium testing.
