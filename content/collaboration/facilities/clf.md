The Central Laser Facility (CLF) is a partnership between its staff and
the large number of members of UK and European universities who use the
specialised laser equipment provided to carry out a broad range of
experiments in physics, chemistry and biology.  CLF provide a broad
spectrum of laser facilities from high intensity laser systems to
ultra-fast sources and laser microscopy techniques.

Astra Gemini is a high power, ultra-short pulse laser system delivering
dual beams of 15 J, 30 fs laser pulses focused to intensities in excess
of 10^21^ W/cm^2^.  The facility was upgraded in 2009 and now uses ICAT
to catalogue shot and metrology data.  This raw data is made available
via a web-based tool to scientists associated with each experiment.  The
data is also combined with other sources to give the operations team an
overview of the performance of the laser.

Two other CLF lasers -- Vulcan and Artemis -- will be incorporated into
ICAT over the next couple of years.
