At the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin f√ºr Materialien und Energie (HZB) we
explore materials and complex material systems that help to face current
and future challenges, such as the energy transition -- "Energiewende".
One of the HZB's research emphases is on materials for thin-film
photovoltaics and for the conversion of solar energy into chemical
energy carriers (e.g. molecular hydrogen).

To be able to study material structures and processes in detail, the HZB
operates two separate large-scale research facilities -- the neutron
source BER II and the synchrotron radiation source BESSY II -- used by
some 3,000 guest scientists from all around the World every year. At
both facilities, HZB teams have developed in some cases unparalleled
instruments and are continuing to work on increasing their measurement
precision to allow for new insights to be gleaned.

The HZB is a member of the Helmholtz Association and co-founder of the
Competence Centre for Thin-Film and Nanotechnology for Photovoltaics
Berlin (PVcomB), whose mission it is to promote the technology transfer
to industry.

The deployment of ICAT at HZB is at an early stage. As of 2015, we
started trial operations with a few beamlines registering their data in
ICAT. We plan to get fully operational, using ICAT as the catalogue to
access the data produced from all instruments at BER II and BESSY II in
the near future.
