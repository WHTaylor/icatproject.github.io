title: OCTOPUS
---

The OCTOPUS (Optics Clustered to Output Unique Solutions) facility, part
of STFC's Central Laser Facility based in the Research Complex at
Harwell in Oxfordshire, is a new concept in laser imaging, in which
multiple light sources are linked to multiple imaging stations allowing
a combination of fluorescence microscopy techniques to be brought to
bear on the samples under investigation. OCTOPUS rallies expertise,
techniques and infrastructure to generate and exploit data for
understanding biological processes at the molecular level from cells to
single molecules. Critical to fully realising the potential of the
imaging data from this variety of complementary imaging methods is
scalable and robust management, processing, visualisation and
interpretation of this information.

OCTOPUS will use ICAT to store and manage its wide variety of both raw
data and processed data, using a customised web interface building on
TopCAT, linking this with management of data processing and
visualisation on STFC computing facilities through a new service, the
ICAT Job Portal (IJP). Metadata is extracted from files and added to the
catalogue for searchability. This will be integrated with other systems,
such as OMERO, so that additional services can be provided to OCTOPUS
users.
